# Healing-Country
Examine the past, present, and likely future climate challenges, and will help communities lead decision-making around climate challenges with relevant agencies and services.

Three states in Australia were considered.
 
* Warumungu (Tennant Creek NT)
* Noongar (Perth WA) and 
* Bundjalung (Northern Rivers NSW)

## Climate variables 

* File name:
    * agcdBandjalung.csv
    * agcdwarumungu.csv
    * agcdKuana.csv
  
 * URL: [The Bureau of Meteorology](http://opendap.bom.gov.au:8080/thredds)
 * Temporal resolution: Monthly
 * Timespan: 1910 - 2024
 * Columns:
     * rainfall (total precipitation, mm)
     * tmax (Maximum temperature, 0C)
     * tmin (Minimum temperature, 0C)

  One major objective of this project is to examinae the seasonal variation over the years across Australia and the below plots presents the identified changes graphically.

* Timespan: 1889 - 2025

Gridded data are available for a range of variables in NetCDF and GeoTiff formats. The NetCDF datasets are arranged in annual blocks where each file contains all of the grids for the selected year and variable.
  
Maximum/Minimum temperature plays a key role in the variation of seasonal changes.

The figure below shows the increase of the sea level in Kuana and the data is from Fremantle tide gauge. The Fremantle tide gauge is the long-running reference for the Perth area (monthly data from 1897 to  2022).

SILO data are not intended for use in climate change detection studies. Small data movements caused by climate change can be easily confounded by changes resulting from instrumental biases and relocating recording stations.
