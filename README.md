# Healing-Country
Examine the past, present, and likely future climate challenges, and will help communities lead decision-making around climate challenges with relevant agencies and services.

Three states in Australia were considered.
 
* Warumungu (Tennant Creek NT)
* Noongar (Perth WA) and 
* Bundjalung (Northern Rivers NSW)

  One major objective of this project is to examinae the seasonal variation over the years across Australia and the below plots presents the identified changes graphically.

       Comments: SILO data are not intended for use in climate change detection studies. Small data movements caused by climate change can be easily confounded by changes resulting from instrumental biases and relocating recording stations.
